# Controlling Workflow & Job Execution

**Controlling Execution Flow** goes beyond step-by-step flows Running jobs and steps conditionally provides greater flexibility by allowing or skipping parts of the workflow based on specific conditions. Using a Matrix to run jobs across multiple configurations, environments, or scenarios simultaneously maximizes efficiency and coverage. Additionally, reusing workflows streamlines processes, reducing redundancy and maintaining consistency.
